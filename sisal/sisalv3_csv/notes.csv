179,"Entity C09-2 (entity_id = 390): Due to the way the age model was constructed (see Warken et al., 2018), lamina counting chronology (dating_lamina) with exact depth, year and uncertainty cannot be provided. The author recommend using the original age model. Bchron (the age model used here) models a short growth slow down at the position of each dating point; this is an artefact from the age model software used and there are no real hiatuses. Mg/Ca is downsampled to annual mean values. An observed seasonal variability of Sr/Ca was sued to manually count chemical lamina to establish a precise age model. The increase in 14C activity is interpreted as the start of the mid-20th century atmospheric bomb peak recorded by the stalagmite. This sets the reference point to the year AD 1955 at 3.2 mm depth from top. Counting of chemical lamina was repeated ten times by different investigators. Each series was anchored to the reference point of the year AD 1955. The distribution of the resulting chronologies allows to assess the uncertainty of lamina counting as standard deviations (sd in dft) of the ensemble and the calculation of the mean age model. We incorporated the age uncertainties in the proxy signal using ensembles of age models, similar to the approach of Dee et al. (2015). Therefore a single lamina counting chronology with exact depth, year and corresponding time uncertainty cannot be provided. Authors recommend using the provided age model for the proxies instead. The final age model is divided into two parts. In the upper 47 mm, the combination of lamina counting and radiocarbon dating provides a precise age model (uncertainty ± 3 years) for the period from AD 1759 to 1973, which is in agreement within error with the uppermost 230Th/U-age (AD 1832 ± 29 at 35 mm depth from top).

309,"Mixed Geology: the hostrock above the cave consists of a 25m thick layer of sandy limestone intercalated with some marl and mudstone, above this layer there is another 20m of calcareous sandstone, silt, carbonate rich shale and marl. \\ GM1 (entity_id = 764) For this specific speleothem it is unknown whether the drip water and modern calcite are in equilibrium, but in other places in this region most drips and modern calcite are not in equilibrium. Mixed age model: U series ages and lamina counting combined. Modern Reference for lamina counting is the year of U-Th chemistry as the lamina counts were anchored using U-Th dates. Annual lamination is based on comparison of the lamination to other speleothems from the same region - in these other speleothems similar lamination has been shown to be annual by radiometric dating. GM1 laminae are similar in thickness and appearance to those other speleothems. Examination of thick sections of GM1at various levels of the growth phases (Fig. 2) showcontinuous and regular visible laminaewith alternating brownish calcite (Dark Compact Laminae, DCL) and thinner white calcite (White Porous Laminae,WPL) as defined by Genty and Quinif (1996) and Genty et al. (1997). The presence of fine sediments on the white porous calcite, and some dissolution features at the top of the DCL, suggests some seasonal infiltration variability (cf. Borsato et al., 2007). Overall, the regularly alternating DCL/WPL laminae sequence, even without more obvious structures from infiltration variability, indicate deposition under a seasonal hydroclimate regime (e.g. changes in dripwater supersaturation or cave air CO2 concentration), where recharge was sufficient to maintain continuous dripping to the stalagmite. Sample data: the stable isotope and trace element analyses were done on powder aliquots that were separately drilled, however data with the same interpolated age (interp_age) were combined together using the depth value of the stable isotope analysis in the original dataset."

327,"The second age–depth model spanned the 110 ka to 45 ka time period, and it is partially presented by both speleothems MP-2 and MP-3 (entity_id = 815, 816). In order to produce a single age–depth model, the chronology data from both speleothems was merged. In the tuning protocol, the MP-2 dataset was used as the main record because it covered the longer time span compared to the MP-3 speleothem. Eight tie points were selected in MP-3, i.e., the MP-2 δ18O depth profiles, to transpose δ18O and δ13C as well as the corresponding U-Th data of the MP-3 speleothem onto the MP-2 depth scale. Tuning and tie point selection was performed based on visual similarity between the two δ18O depth series. Linear interpolation was performed in between tie points to transpose all MP-3 data onto the MP2 depth scale. Original depth uncertainty of the MP-3 U-Th samples was increased for at least 25% to account for an extra error introduced by this tuning protocol and this increased uncertainty was then applied in the age–depth modelling procedure. All accepted ages are in stratigraphic order as presented in Figure 3b."
